This package allows easy access to resources which can be located on different places, depending on conditions the application is
being executed under. A good example of usage would be when an application needs to find configuration information under a specific
directory, which may be environment dependent.
<ul>
    <li>
When still in development, the application should pick up configuration files from the classpath, provided by the IDE, possibly.
In the specific case of Eclipse, it creates folders "target/classes" and "target/test-classes" which are neither the locatons where
the developer choose for configuration files nor the locations where these files will sit when the applicaton is deployed onto
production. We would like a sort of "Eclipse mode" in our application, which makes it find configuration files where Eclipse put
them.
    </li>
    <li>
When the application is packaged, it must be able to pick up configuration files from its own .jar file.
Inside the .jar file, there's a specific location, chosen by the developer, where configuration files can be found.
    </li>
    <li>
In production, support personnel eventually will desire the ability to change configuration parameters, providing configurations
not considered or not even permitted when the application was still in development. In this case, the "location chosen by the
developer" should be considered as present in the file system, and not in the .jar file.
    </li>
</ul>
<p/>
This typical scenario requires the ability to look for a resource in a list of locations.
An easy way to do it is simply define a relative location, say "./config", which is a relative directory, which can be found
in the file system, in the .jar file itself, or relative to folders Eclipse creates, depending on the way the application is
running.
<p/>
The critical factor here is that the developer would like the ability to specify the configuration file only once and let more
precise definition for a later opportunity, according to the environment and even production support decision.
This can be actually be done easily by the code below, which employs the classes defined by this package.
<pre>
    InputStream is = new ResourceLookup("config/application.properties").openInputStream();
</pre>
<p/>
Now let's suppose we generate different distributions of our application, say, one different distribution for each client.
One easy way to configure the application would be to insert an entry in the MANIFEST.MF file, which helps determine the exact
location of the configuration files.
<p/>
One difficulty of this approach is that the location of MANIFEST.MF changes, depending if you are debugging your application under
Eclipse, running from the command line, given a .jar file for your application or running from the command line when the .jar file
is exploded.
<p/>
A solution would be employ <i>ResourceLookup</i> again like this:
<pre>
    final Manifest manifest;
    try {
        manifest = new Manifest(new ResourceLookup("META-INF/MANIFEST.MF").openInputStream());
    } catch (final IOException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("No META-INF/MANIFEST.MF found");
    }
    String clientName = manifest.getMainAttributes().getAttribute("client", "debug"); // returns "debug", if entry is not found
    InputStream is = new ResourceLookup("config/" + clientName + "/application.properties").openInputStream();
</pre>
    </body>
