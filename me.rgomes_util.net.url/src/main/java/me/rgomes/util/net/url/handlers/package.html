This package allows easy access to <i>file:</i> and <i>classpath:</i> protocols.
<p/>
This package solves two problems:
<ul>
    <li>
        There's no <i>classpath:</i> protocol. The existence of such protocol makes life far more easier when an application
        needs to find resources located in the classpath.
    </li>
    <li>
        The legacy <i>file:</i> protocol does not allow relative addresses. The possibility of relative addresses leverages the
        retrieval of resources which are located under the current working directory with ease.
    </li>
</ul>
