This package allows easy access to resources which can be located on different places, depending on conditions the application is
being executed under. A good example of usage would be when an application needs to find configuration information under a specific
directory, which may be environment dependent.
<ul>
    <li>
When still in development, the application should pick up configuration files from the classpath, provided by the IDE, possibly.
In the specific case of Eclipse, it creates folders "target/classes" and "target/test-classes" which are neither the locations where
the developer choose for configuration files nor the locations where these files will sit when the application is deployed onto
production. We would like a sort of "Eclipse mode" in our application, which makes it find configuration files where Eclipse put
them.
    </li>
    <li>
When the application is packaged, it must be able to pick up configuration files from its own .jar file.
Inside the .jar file, there's a specific location, chosen by the developer, where configuration files can be found.
    </li>
    <li>
In production, support personnel eventually will desire the ability to change configuration parameters, providing configurations
not considered or not even permitted when the application was still in development. In this case, the "location chosen by the
developer" should be considered as present in the file system, and not in the .jar file.
    </li>
</ul>
<p/>
This typical scenario requires the ability to look for a resource in a list of locations.
An easy way to do it is simply define a relative location, say "./conf", which is a relative directory, which can be found
in the file system, in the .jar file itself, or relative to folders Eclipse creates, depending on the way the application is
running. More than that, we would like the ability to specify that a certain configuration is relative to a certain customer and
to a certain environment in particular. Actually, we could have several configurations, like this:
<pre>
    /conf
        /MyFirstCustomer
            /dev
                application.properties
            /qa
                application.properties
            /prod
                application.properties
        /BigCustomer
            /dev
                application.properties
            /test
                application.properties
            /qa
                application.properties
            /stage
                application.properties
            /prod
                application.properties
        /demo
            /debug
                application.properties
            /stage
                application.properties

</pre>
<p/>
The critical factor here is that the developer would like the ability to specify the configuration file in the source code only once
and let the environment itself tell which configuration file must be taken.
This can be actually be done easily by the code below:
<pre>
    URLStreamHandler handler = new me.rgomes.protocols.conf.Handler();
    InputStream is = new URL(null, "conf:application.properties", handler).openStream();
</pre>
<p/>
But... how the environment "itself" finds the correct configuration file?
<p/>
There are two ways of doing it:
<ul>
    <li>
        entries <i>realm</i> and <mode> are taken from the MANIFEST.MF file;
    </li>
    <li>
        entries <i>realm</i> and <mode> are taken global.properties file;
    </li>
</ul>
This is an example of what you can specify in conf/globals.properties:
<pre>
realm=BigCustomer
mode=stage
</pre>
    </body>
